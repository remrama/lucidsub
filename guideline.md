# r/LucidDreaming Codebook

<br>

There are 10 sub-themes to use for coding. Each sub-theme is a part of 1 of 2 main themes: _Positive effects_ and _Negative effects_ of lucid dreaming.

Highlight any relevant section of a post to code it under 1 of the 13 sub-themes.

See the **Theme Summary Table** below for brief examples of each sub-theme.

See the **Detailed Theme Descriptions** section below for an in-depth definition and more extensive examples of each sub-theme.

In the Detailed Theme Descriptions section, there's a **bolded section of each example denotes which section would be highlighted in the example**. Though don't stress over what exact text gets highlighted, it's far more important to catch _something_ within a relevant post (err on the side of over-highlighting).

## Positive effects


<br>

### 1.1 Nightmare resolution

> **Definition:** Any time an explicit connection is made between lucid dreaming and the reduction of bad dream content. Common examples include, but are not limited to, when a user mentions becoming lucid during a bad dream and (a) waking up from it, (b) changing the content, or (c) being comfortable with the knowledge that it's not real.
>
> **Examples:**
> * _... a giant wave was forming, ready to hit everyone at the beach. I started running and rushed to a high spot. **I got this feeling: "Wait, I am dreaming. This is another one of my nightmares." And I said out loud: "I don't want a tsunami, I want to be safe". And in one second, I was sitting at a cafe, safe.** I don't remember what happened after that, but, for the first time, after almost 6 months, **I woke up from a tsunami nightmare and didn't have excessive anxiety over it, because I realized it wasn't really happening**._
> * _I've been a lucid dreamer ever since I was a kid and started having reoccurring dreams. **I had gotten the hang of it pretty well and could even think my way out of sticky situations most times.**_
> * _... The only experience I have with this is that in my childhood, **I eventually gained the ability to recognise nightmares, and I could wake myself up**. It was weird, I don't remember how I did it, but I remember it felt like I'd start moving my limbs irl and then that woke me up. **Now I just don't get nightmares** so hey that worked out well._


<br>

### 1.2 Positive waking mood

> Any reference to lucidity resulting in a positive mood during the day, especially upon awakening in the morning. It is okay to use context of a post to infer positive waking mood when it is not explicitly mentioned. Such positive emotions commonly referred to include, but are not limited to, feeling refreshed, excited, and/or happy.
>
> * ... _**I remember waking up happy and I began to look forward to dreaming at night**. I began using this as an escape from real life traumatic experiences occurring atm._
> * **Success!!** After months of trying I finally had my first lucid dream.


<br>

### 1.3 Dream enhancement

> Any reference to dreams being enhanced by lucidity. This most commonly shows up as, but is not limited to, (a) the dreamer taking intentional pleasure-seeking action such as flying or sex, (b) an excitement or amazement during the dream, and/or (c) superior dream vividness.
>
> * _The first lucid dream I can recall was in middle school. I remember I was walking to school in the scorching sun and was running late. It was then where I sorta snapped? And was like "hey you're dreaming" and **I began to glide off the cement and soar through to class**._
> * _... I stood up and yelled "I'm dreaming!". I went into hyper speed. When I looked to the right I could see white and black fractals to my side with lines passing by. I started getting anxious about going so far to the moon and thought that I should go back to the house to see what that person had to tell me. This is when I woke up. This is by far the most vivid lucid dream I had, **it looked as authentic if not more authentic than waking life**._
> * _... **I had a lucid dream last night and was quite excited as I find having sex in them to be very fun and rewarding**, much more so than flying and exploring. The problem was I couldn't find anyone who was my "type" despite that I searched and searched for a long time. I felt like I couldn't find anyone so I tried to "create" them which resulted in me getting frustrated and waking myself up. Needless to say I was pretty bummed and when I fell back asleep it was a normal dream._


<br>

### 1.4 Rehearsal

> Any explicit reference to the use of lucid dreams as a "virtual practice ground" for a waking activity/event. Examples might include, but of course are not limited to, practicing sports or rehearsing a public speech in a lucid dream.
>
> * _... **It is possible to practice piano, I've done it once though it was strange.** My fingers were not the problem but the keys were somewhat off when I took a closer look and the music I played sounded different from what I expected ..._
> * _**I learned swimming by lucid dreaming.** I just came to realization that it was a lucid dream. One day I woke up from my dream and went swimming and I was able to swim. Feels so weird now thinking about it._
> * ... It's very useful for this sort of thing. **I've personally drilled fencing movements in dreams and found them smoother the next day, as if I'd spent hours working on them.**_
> * _I have composed both melodies and lyrics in dreams, but **I have also tried to practice the piano in dreams and it was nearly impossible**. My hands were all crazy and I just couldn't focus. That's not to say that it wouldn't work for anyone, but it was a no-go in my experience._


<br>

### 1.5 Creativity/insight

> Any reference to a creative action in the dream or a realization made while dreaming that has an outcome on waking life. This also includes comments and questions about lucid dreaming being used for creativity/insight. Examples commonly include (a) asking the lucid dream a solution to a real life problem and (b) creating a piece of artwork during the lucid dream.
>
> * _**I have composed both melodies and lyrics in dreams**, but I have also tried to practice the piano in dreams and it was nearly impossible. My hands were all crazy and I just couldn't focus. That's not to say that it wouldn't work for anyone, but it was a no-go in my experience._
> * _When I was in college **I asked some monster for an answer to a calculus problem I couldn't get (went lucid since no such thing as monsters), to my surprise they were right when I tried what they said irl**..._


<br>



## Negative effects


<br>

### 2.1 Sleep paralysis

> Any reference to sleep paralysis or related phenomena (e.g., visual or auditory hallucinations, especially demonic characters, a feeling of weight/presence on the chest). Sleep paralysis includes both explicit references to "sleep paralysis" or a descriptive account of a feeling of being conscious but unable to move. This includes situations of sleep paralysis that occur before/after a lucid dream, or posts about sleep paralysis that don't mention lucidity explicitly.
>
> * _... **Got auditory hallucinations of some demon lady whispering, coming closer and closer.** Couldn't sleep for the rest of the night. No thanks._
> * _**Just had my first sleep paralysis experience** and I wanna share it. I fell asleep to a live stream, just to help me fall asleep, but the person streaming starting talking about ghosts and how theyâ€™re not real. For some reason the word "ghost" spooked me and I'm guessing that's what drove me to have the paralysis cause next thing I know **I wasn't able to move and at first all I heard was the sound of the live stream playing and them talking about how ghosts are fake. I was under the covers lying on my back so I couldn't really see my room then I heard a growl right next to me** ..._


<br>

### 2.2 Reality confusion

> Any expression of being wrong about one's state of consciousness (_excluding_ typical non-lucid dream misperceptions and sleep paralysis). Primarily these are references to (a) wake being dream-like or (b) thinking one has woken but still non-lucid dreaming (i.e., false awakenings).
>
> * _... so I had an LD few hours ago, and **I got a false awakening but I didn't realize that so I just instantly got my dream journal out and started writing what I remember from my dream. Then I woke up for real and was confused for like 10 seconds**, then just wrote everything down on my dream journal._
> * _I haven't lucid dreamt, as far as I know, but **lately I have been waking up and experiencing skewed ideas about reality. There have been a couple of instances where something happened in a dream and I would wake up and not remember if it happened the day before or in the dream, later on after a lot of thought, I was able to rule out that it was a dream memory.** These instances have caused me a bit of anxiety._


<br>

### 2.3 Poor sleep

> Any reference to poor or degregaded sleep quality, including that as a result from (a) induction methods or (b) dream content, as well as (c) poor sleep leading to lucidity.
>
> * _**I Lucid Dream almost every single night, sometimes so vividly and intense that I wake up exhausted from my dream. I wake up more tired than when I feel asleep.** Any tips to downgrade my level of lucid dreaming?? lol I love my dreams, it's incredibly fascinating but can be a bit much sometimes?_
> * _I naturally lucid dream once every one or two months. I have tried SSILD about 6 times of which I became lucid 4 times. **My problem is that after doing the cycles I can't fall asleep quickly. I'm awake for at least 10-15 mins.** I have used the searchbar but other posts don't provide a solution to this problem. **Also I sometimes wake up in advance of my 4 am alarm. This causes me to somewhat stay awake until the alarm goes off. The method kind of works for me but it leaves me with sleep deprivation in the morning.**_


<br>

### 2.4 Unwanted lucid dreams

> Any mention of a user having naturally occuring lucid dreams and not being able to make them stop (despite wanting to).
>
> * _... **Eventually it becomes really tiring and although I do really appreciate being able to lucid dream, I just want to be able to relax sometimes and not have to think of things.**_
> * _I had a pretty frightening series of false awakenings last night, where over and over and over I woke up in my room and realized I was dreaming either naturally or by something "off" in my environment. **I did not try and induce lucidity.  Sometimes it just happens.**_


<br>

### 2.5 Lucid dysphoria

> Any reference to a dyshoric/bad dream or nightmare where the dreamer is lucid and unable to do anything positive about it. Note this does not include bad dreams or nightmares that do not involve lucidity. They must specify being lucid prior to or during the nightmare, and that they are unable to do anything about it (e.g., use lucidity to "fix" or adjust the dream).
>
> * _I've been a lucid dreamer ever since I was a kid and started having reoccurring dreams. I had gotten the hang of it pretty well and could even think my way out of sticky situations most times. However, **since I've been pregnant I've had the gnarliest and most vile unthinkable dreams that either moved too fast for me to change the scenario or they just down right scare me and I wake up immediately. I was just awoken by a lucid dream turned night terror** and in the beginning it was all good..._
> * _... I decided that I wanted to break the atmospheric barrier, but the sky had a surface tension to it, until suddenly I was in the stars. It was a disturbing and disorienting experience. I was looking for my spiritual teacher, but kept spinning, not unlike what it feels like when you're drunk..._
